Your efforts will aid GoFood at a level of detail that enables our stakeholders to identify and address critical issues and align deliverables according to the team’s priorities and requirements.
What You Will Do
Craft strategic initiatives for GoFood that are focused on analysis and experimentation; work closely with the Content & Quality streams to improve the platform’s user experience
Deliver insight and analysis using statistical tools, data visualization, and business use cases with the Product and Business teams
Conduct analysis to determine new project pilot settings, new features, user behavior, and in-app behavior
Build & maintain dashboards for tracking business performance and product adoption
Assist Product Managers and Business teams in creating data-backed decisions
Collaborate with GoFood’s Product and Business teams in identifying new avenues for growth and opportunities, and back their product delivery with experimentation

Strong ability to design and conduct simple experiments
A goal-oriented, critical-thinking mindset with the ability to work equally well within a team and independently with minimal supervisionAbout the Team
Our GoFood Data squad is a family of around 20 GoTroops based in India and Indonesia. Together, we run Southeast Asia’s fastest-growing food delivery service. As nasi goreng is to the people of Indonesia, we are to Gojek: providing the nourishment to sustain our business from the inside out.
The gist of our role is to oversee all things data for GoFood, acting as a thought partner for our Business and Product teams to make well-analyzed, data-backed business decisions to ultimately fuel GoFood’s innovations and evolutions. Through the use of our data products (automated dashboards, reports, alerts, and simulation tools), we dive deep into data surrounding user experience, adoption rates, and in-app behavior, conducting experiments to better understand what makes our users and products gel.
So far, our team has created a massive impact across various user journeys - from search, recommendations, the discovery of merchants, to food preparation time, just to name a few. We’re currently hard at work with our Product Managers to construct new machine learning solutions for projects surrounding the reduction of wait times to the expansion of food variety.
All that said, don’t be fooled by our hard work; we know how to play hard, too. Contrary to popular belief, our team actually enjoys each other’s company. When we aren’t busy analyzing user trends or conducting experiments, you’ll find us ordering some delicious meals on GoFood (what can we say... we're loyal), battling it out in a game of Among Us, or trying to survive an intense workout session together.";Posted29 hari yang lalu;https://id.indeed.com/rc/clk?jk=8ea21f992ccce982&fccid=35c79097c1f63f3d&vjs=3

Permanent
Application Posted
October 25, 2021
About the Role
As our Business Intelligence Analyst, you’ll be an instrumental player in the GoFood team based in Bengaluru. Collaborating with the Business and Product teams, you’ll focus your efforts on supporting the analytics and data products (automated dashboards, reports, alerts, and simulation tools) which aim to create business impact at scale. Specifically, you’ll conduct general analysis on each new feature/product, dive deep into understanding user behavior insights to make sound business decisions, and provide data visualizations to track GoFood’s overall performances. Your efforts will aid GoFood at a level of detail that enables our stakeholders to identify and address critical issues and align deliverables according to the team’s priorities and requirements.
What You Will Do
Craft strategic initiatives for GoFood that are focused on analysis and experimentation; work closely with the Content & Quality streams to improve the platform’s user experience
Deliver insight and analysis using statistical tools, data visualization, and business use cases with the Product and Business teams
Conduct analysis to determine new project pilot settings, new features, user behavior, and in-app behavior
Build & maintain dashboards for tracking business performance and product adoption
Assist Product Managers and Business teams in creating data-backed decisions
Collaborate with GoFood’s Product and Business teams in identifying new avenues for growth and opportunities, and back their product delivery with experimentation
Build first cut Machine Learning models based on product requirements
Automate data extraction by creating de-normalized tablesWhat You Will Need
At least 4 years of work experience dealing with product analytics, data, and statistics
Expertise in SQL with experience using data visualization and dashboarding tools (e.g. Tableau, Metabase, Google Data Studio, Clevertap, Python)
Experience in Machine Learning technologies (i.e. forecasting, clustering, statistical significance test, predictive modeling, and text mining)
Experience in delivering products as end-to-end data solutions (from data pipelining to analysis, presenting, and scalable adaption)
A strong business sense with the ability to transform ambiguous business and product issues into well-scoped, impactful analysis
Strong ability to design and conduct simple experiments
A goal-oriented, critical-thinking mindset with the ability to work equally well within a team and independently with minimal supervisionAbout the Team
Our GoFood Data squad is a family of around 20 GoTroops based in India and Indonesia. Together, we run Southeast Asia’s fastest-growing food delivery service. As nasi goreng is to the people of Indonesia, we are to Gojek: providing the nourishment to sustain our business from the inside out.
The gist of our role is to oversee all things data for GoFood, acting as a thought partner for our Business and Product teams to make well-analyzed, data-backed business decisions to ultimately fuel GoFood’s innovations and evolutions. Through the use of our data products (automated dashboards, reports, alerts, and simulation tools), we dive deep into data surrounding user experience, adoption rates, and in-app behavior, conducting experiments to better understand what makes our users and products gel.
So far, our team has created a massive impact across various user journeys - from search, recommendations, the discovery of merchants, to food preparation time, just to name a few. We’re currently hard at work with our Product Managers to construct new machine learning solutions for projects surrounding the reduction of wait times to the expansion of food variety.
All that said, don’t be fooled by our hard work; we know how to play hard, too. Contrary to popular belief, our team actually enjoys each other’s company. When we aren’t busy analyzing user trends or conducting experiments, you’ll find us ordering some delicious meals on GoFood (what can we say... we're loyal), battling it out in a game of Among Us, or trying to survive an intense workout session together.";Posted29 hari yang lalu;https://id.indeed.com/rc/clk?jk=8ea21f992ccce982&fccid=35c79097c1f63f3d&vjs=3

About the TeamOur Payments team oversees GoPay (Southeast Asia’s fastest-growing consumer payments and financial services app), as well as Midtrans (one of Indonesia’s largest payment gateways), and Spots (Indonesia’s largest offline network for payments).

Our Merchant Payments team is part of the larger Payments platform, and consists of passionate engineers based in Jakarta, Singapore, and Gurgaon. We run Southeast Asia’s leading financial platform for online and onsite merchants. It's our job to oversee all things related to empowering business owners, and to create a seamless and efficient payment gateway solution. We also take the time to understand our merchant-partners daily concerns and experiences in order to cater our services to resolve any hurdles and expand their operations. The big question that we’re always trying to solve is: How can we better improve our digital experience for our merchants-partners.

We've helped simplify payments for over 300,000 merchant-partners in our respective regions - from retail stores in town to your favorite Gorengan and Martabak stalls. But, the growth of Payments does not stop here. We are hungry for more. We intend to become the largest payment and financial services group in Southeast Asia. We are working on several projects now, including one about enhancing direct interaction with our merchant-partners of a variety of businesses and their customers.

We’re a high-performing, tight-knit team who are committed to the growth of the company, as well as each other’s personal growth and well-being. Pre-COVID, factions of our team would enjoy catching up over a round of drinks after work. However, with WFH becoming more normalized, we've been sharing our favorite ways to prioritize a healthy work-life balance at home. Off-hours, you’d probably find us binging The Queen’s Gambit on Netflix, whipping up a loaf of sourdough bread, or trying our best to survive a HIIT workout on YouTube.
